Find resources, talk to their teachers, even though sometimes they don't feel like they are listening.  You have to ask questions to get answers.
Get involved in Sports, Clubs, just get involved as much as possible.

Talk about College (UO)
It's ok for them to not know how to get there, but it's not ok to not ask questions.  You can't get there on your own, there are teachers/counselors who care and want to help you.
Perhaps show something I did at UO.
Clubs that I joined, and how that helped me learn and grow as a POC.

AiPD
Even though you have a 4 year degree, you never stop learning.
Had to find other avenues of how to get to where you want to go.
Push yourselves as much as possible.

Cost, yes it's scary, but there are ways to get money.  How did I do it?  Since Freshman year in HS, give it your all.

How I was able to network from AiPD that led me to my job.  Networking is key.

Show/talk about where I am now.
